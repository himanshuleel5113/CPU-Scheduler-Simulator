# Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

## Project Overview
This project simulates CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. It allows users to input process details (arrival time, burst time, priority) and visualizes the scheduling process using Gantt charts.

## Features
- Input module for process details.
- Implementation of FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling algorithms.
- Visualization of Gantt charts and performance metrics (average waiting time, turnaround time).

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib (for visualization)
- **Tools:** GitHub (for version control)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `code` folder.
3. Run `main.py` to start the simulator.
